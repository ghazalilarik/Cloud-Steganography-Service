### Cloud-Based Steganography Service

#### Introduction
This cloud-based steganography service allows users to securely upload an image and hide secret information within it. The data is securely encrypted before being embedded into the image, ensuring data privacy and protection. The tool also provides a mechanism to retrieve the hidden information using a secure decryption method.

#### Features
- **Image Upload and Data Embedding**: Users can securely upload images and embed secret information within them.
- **Data Encryption**: Secret information is encrypted before being embedded in the image to ensure security.
- **Data Retrieval**: Retrieve hidden information from a steganographic image.
- **User-Friendly API**: Provides simple endpoints for uploading images and retrieving hidden data.

#### Usage Instructions
1. **Setup Dependencies**: Install necessary packages using `pip`.
    ```sh
    pip install Flask opencv-python cryptography
    ```
2. **Run the Service**: Start the Flask server using the following command.
    ```sh
    python cloud_steganography_service.py
    ```
3. **Endpoints**:
   - **Upload and Hide Data**: `POST /upload`
     - Form data: `file` (image), `data` (text to hide).
     - Returns an image with hidden data.
   - **Retrieve Hidden Data**: `POST /retrieve`
     - Form data: `file` (image with hidden data).
     - Returns the hidden data as a JSON response.

#### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.6 or above**: Ensure you have Python installed in your system.
- **Flask**: For creating a web server.
- **OpenCV and Cryptography**: To process images and handle encryption.

#### Implementation Steps
1. **Clone Repository**: Clone this repository from GitHub.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Use the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all dependencies.
3. **Configure Upload Folder**: The script saves uploaded files in an `uploads` folder.
4. **Run the Tool**: Run the Flask server using `python cloud_steganography_service.py`.
